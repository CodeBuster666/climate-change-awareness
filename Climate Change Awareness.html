                <h4>What is Climate Changes?</h4>
                <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                &emsp;Climate change refers to significant changes in average weather conditions—such 
                as becoming warmer, wetter, or drier—over several decades or more. This long-term 
                trend distinguishes climate change from natural weather variability. Its effects
                are diverse, including record floods, raging storms, and deadly heat, impacting 
                all living beings, but not equally. Economically disadvantaged communities and 
                people of color, who contribute the least to its causes, suffer the most from its 
                impacts. The basics include understanding the causes of climate change, its effects 
                on the planet and people, and potential solutions.

                <h4 >What is Climate Change and Global Heating?<br/>How Does it Work to Affect Our Lives?</h4>
                <p>
                    Climate change, or global warming, results from Earth's average temperature 
                    increase due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations and human-induced emissions. 
                    Greenhouse gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, 
                    and ozone trap heat radiation in the atmosphere, intensifying warming by 
                    absorbing and emitting heat. This phenomenon alters global climate patterns, 
                    driven primarily by human activities, with scientific consensus attributing 
                    over 95% of observed warming to these factors.

                                They discussed combining volunteerism advocacy with climate change 
                                awareness during Earth Month and CCC Week. PNVSCA proposed Volunteer
